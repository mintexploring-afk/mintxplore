# Payment Modal - Loading & Success States Fix

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Success message showing as error on NFT detail page
**Problem**: When purchase succeeded, the page showed "Failed to purchase NFT" even though the purchase was successful.

**Root Cause**: The success message was being set on the page-level message state with type 'success', but the page wasn't differentiating between success and error messages in the UI.

**Solution**: Don't set page-level messages on success, only show success state in the modal itself.

### Issue 2: Modal closing too quickly or not showing success state
**Problem**: The payment modal wasn't showing a proper success state after successful purchase.

**Root Cause**: The modal needed distinct loading and success states.

**Solution**: Implemented three distinct modal states:
1. **Normal State**: Payment selection with balances
2. **Loading State**: Processing animation with spinner
3. **Success State**: Green checkmark with success message

## Implementation Details

### Payment Modal Component (`PaymentModal.tsx`)

**Added Props**:
```typescript
success?: boolean;              // Shows success state
selectedCurrency?: 'ETH' | 'WETH' | null; // Currency used for payment
```

**Three States**:

1. **Success State** (when `success === true`):
   - Green circle with CheckCircle2 icon
   - "Purchase Successful!" heading
   - Shows payment currency used
   - Transaction complete message
   - Auto-redirects after 3 seconds

2. **Loading State** (when `loading === true && !success`):
   - Blue circle with spinning Loader2 icon
   - "Processing Payment..." heading
   - Shows payment currency being processed
   - "Do not close this window" warning

3. **Normal State** (when `!loading && !success`):
   - Full payment selection interface
   - Balance checks
   - Payment options

### NFT Detail Page (`nft/[id]/page.tsx`)

**Added State**:
```typescript
const [purchaseSuccess, setPurchaseSuccess] = useState(false)
const [selectedPaymentCurrency, setSelectedPaymentCurrency] = useState<'ETH' | 'WETH' | null>(null)
```

**Updated Purchase Flow**:
```typescript
if (res.ok) {
  // 1. Stop loading spinner
  setPurchasing(false)
  
  // 2. Show success state in modal
  setPurchaseSuccess(true)
  
  // 3. Keep modal open for 3 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    setShowPaymentModal(false)
    setPurchaseSuccess(false)
    router.push('/dashboard')
  }, 3000)
}
```

**Modal Props Updated**:
- Added `success={purchaseSuccess}`
- Added `selectedCurrency={selectedPaymentCurrency}`
- Updated `onClose` to prevent closing during purchase

## User Experience Flow

### Successful Purchase:
1. User clicks payment option (ETH or WETH)
2. Modal shows **Loading State**:
   - Spinning icon
   - "Processing Payment..."
   - "Do not close this window"
3. Purchase completes successfully
4. Modal transitions to **Success State**:
   - Green checkmark animation
   - "Purchase Successful!"
   - "You paid with ETH/WETH and now own this NFT"
   - "Transaction Complete - Redirecting to your dashboard..."
5. After 3 seconds:
   - Modal closes
   - Redirects to dashboard

### Failed Purchase:
1. User clicks payment option
2. Modal shows **Loading State**
3. Purchase fails
4. Modal returns to **Normal State**
5. Error message appears on NFT detail page
6. User can try again or close modal
