# Dashboard Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **NFT Email Notifications Implemented** ✅
Added comprehensive email notification system for the entire NFT lifecycle:

#### Email Templates Created (`/src/utils/emailTemplates.ts`):
- `getNFTMintedEmailTemplate()` - Sent when user mints an NFT
- `getNFTApprovedEmailTemplate()` - Sent when admin approves an NFT
- `getNFTRejectedEmailTemplate()` - Sent when admin rejects an NFT
- `getNFTSoldEmailTemplate()` - Sent to seller when NFT is sold
- `getNFTPurchasedEmailTemplate()` - Sent to buyer when they purchase an NFT

#### API Routes Updated:
1. **`/api/nfts` (POST)** - Sends "NFT Minted" email after successful minting
2. **`/api/nfts` (PUT)** - Sends "NFT Approved" or "NFT Rejected" email based on admin action
3. **`/api/nfts/[id]/purchase` (POST)** - Sends both "NFT Sold" and "NFT Purchased" emails

All emails feature:
- Responsive HTML table-based layout
- Gradient headers matching action type
- NFT preview images
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Professional design consistent with existing templates

- Links use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable

### Dashboard State Management:
- Fetches real-time data on load
- Uses React hooks for state management
- Loading states for better UX
- Error handling with console logs

### TypeScript Warnings:
- Minor `any` type usage in filters (non-breaking)
