## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New API Endpoint:
- **`GET /api/transactions`**
  - Returns user's transactions sorted by date (newest first)
  - Limit: 500 transactions
  - Protected with JWT
  - Returns: `{ type, amount, network, status, description, createdAt }`

### Existing Endpoints Used:
- **`GET /api/deposits`** - User's deposit history
- **`GET /api/withdrawals`** - User's withdrawal history

### State Management:
- Each page uses React hooks for:
  - Active tab selection
  - Loading states
  - Data fetching
  - Filter management

### Fetch Logic:
- Data fetched on tab switch
- useEffect dependencies include tab state
- Conditional rendering based on active tab
