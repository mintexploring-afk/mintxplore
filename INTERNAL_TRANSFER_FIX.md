# Internal Transfer Fix

## Issue Summary
When an internal withdrawal was approved by an admin:
- ✅ The sender's balance was correctly deducted
- ❌ The recipient's balance was NOT credited

## Root Cause
The admin withdrawal approval API (`/api/admin/withdrawals`) only handled the sender's balance deduction but did not check if the withdrawal type was "internal" to credit the recipient.

## Solution Implemented

### What Was Added
In `/src/app/api/admin/withdrawals/route.ts`, added logic to handle internal transfers:

1. **Check withdrawal type**: After deducting sender's balance, check if `withdrawal.type === 'internal'`

2. **Find recipient**: Query the recipient by email from `withdrawal.destination`
   ```typescript
   const recipient = await User.findOne({ email: withdrawal.destination });
   ```

3. **Credit recipient's balance**: Add the withdrawal amount to recipient's balance
   ```typescript
   recipient.balances[networkKey] = (recipient.balances[networkKey] || 0) + withdrawal.amount;
   recipient.markModified('balances');
   await recipient.save();
   ```

4. **Log recipient transaction**: Create a deposit transaction for the recipient
   ```typescript
   await Transaction.create({
     user: recipient._id,
     type: 'deposit',
     amount: withdrawal.amount,
     network: withdrawal.network,
     status: 'completed',
     reference: withdrawal._id,
     referenceModel: 'Withdrawal',
     description: `Internal transfer received from ${user.email}: ${withdrawal.amount} ${withdrawal.network}`,
   });
   ```

5. **Send email notification**: Notify the recipient they received a transfer
   - Shows sender's name and email
   - Shows transfer amount
   - Shows new balance
   - Includes any note from the sender

## How It Works Now

### Internal Transfer Flow:
1. User A requests withdrawal (type: internal, destination: userB@email.com)
2. Admin approves the withdrawal
3. **Sender (User A)**:
   - Balance deducted: `balance -= amount`
   - Transaction logged (type: withdrawal, amount: -X)
   - Email sent: "Withdrawal Approved"
4. **Recipient (User B)**:
   - Balance credited: `balance += amount`
   - Transaction logged (type: deposit, amount: +X)
   - Email sent: "You Received a Transfer"

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. User A creates internal withdrawal to `apollos.m1601012@st.futminna.edu.ng`
2. Admin approves the withdrawal
3. Check console logs:
   - `✅ Withdrawal approved: Updated userA@email.com WETH balance to X`
   - `✅ Internal transfer: Credited apollos.m1601012@st.futminna.edu.ng WETH balance to Y`
4. Check database:
   - User A balance decreased
   - User B (apollos.m1601012@st.futminna.edu.ng) balance increased
   - Two transactions created (one withdrawal, one deposit)
5. Check emails:
   - User A receives "Withdrawal Approved" email
   - User B receives "You Received a Transfer" email

## User Verification
Confirmed user `apollos.m1601012@st.futminna.edu.ng` has:
- ✅ Balance fields in database: `{ WETH: 0, ETH: 0 }`
- ✅ Email verified: `true`
- ✅ Active account ready to receive transfers

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/api/admin/withdrawals/route.ts` - Added internal transfer handling
